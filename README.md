# Discovering Interesting Patterns In MSNBC.com Anonymous Web Data using Frequent Pattern Mining Algorithms

In this study, we intended to find inherent regularities within a user’s web page clicks using msnbc.com anonymous web data [1]. Within the dataset, each user’s web navigations are presented and our goal is to discover interesting web page patterns and increase users’ satisfaction point. For instance, we can reveal frequent paths to the target web pages and create some shortcuts to fasten the users’ navigation. For these purposes, we used Spark ML library and performed association rule mining and sequential rule mining techniques to generate rules and evaluated the interestingness of these rules with some metrics.
